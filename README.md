## ðŸ’» Project

The aim of this project is to solve a fullstack challenge by fetching API data on a React app.

## ðŸš€ Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime.
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) - React components for faster and easier web development.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/) - web framework for Node.js.
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client.

## :floppy_disk: Getting started

Get [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.\
Verify you have everything installed correctly:
```sh
node --version
```
Get [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your machine. It's faster than the NPM package manager installed together with node.\
Verify you have everything installed correctly:
```sh
yarn -v
```
Create a directory for this repo and clone it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Henrinacio/react-node-chuck-challenge.git
```

Initialize project inside both folders (myfrontend and mybackend)
```sh
yarn init -y
```

## :art: Back-end & Front-end

Run the back-end server in the development mode (hosted on http://localhost:5000)
```sh
yarn start
```
Run the front-end server in the development mode:
```sh
yarn start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
